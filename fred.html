Question: Write a program that prints the name Fred 100 times, one time per line.
<br></br>
Response: for number in range(100):
            <br></br>print(number+1, 'Fred')
<br></br>            
<br></br>            
Question: Write a program that prints the name Fred 100 times, one time per line. Do not use for or while. 
Instead, create a function called printFred that takes in a number and prints Fred that number of times. 
The function operates by displaying the name Fred
once and then calling itself with the next smaller number, if that number is at least
one. The call printFred(100) should do what we want.
<br></br>
Response: def printFred(times)
              <br></br>print('Fred')
              <br></br>if times-1 > 0:
                  <br></br>printFred(times-1)
<br></br>                  
printFred(100)
<br></br>

Question: Write a program that prints the name Fred 100 times, one time per line. Your program should be reasonably short and should not include a list containing more
than ten items or a string containing more than ten characters.

                <br></br>for x in tendashes:
